- Show the sequence of function calls that take place if
a process is running with interrupts enabled and a timer
interrupt occurs.

- What does the stack look like as we enter pic_irq? The running
process doesn't know that it's getting interrupted, who saves
its registers, ESP, PC, and FLAGS? Where?

- Let's say process A (count > 0) is switching to process B
(count == 0), who turns on interrupts? when?

- Let's say process A (count == 0) is switching to process B
(count > 0), who turns off interrupts? when?

- What happens if you get interrupted while you in the
middle of a context switch? Does that lead to recursive
context switching? What does it mean?
